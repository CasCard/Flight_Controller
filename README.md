# Flight Controller #

A simple arduino based flight controller that uses MPU6050 Gyro-Accelerometer and NRF24L01 transmission-Reciever module.

## Use Case ##

Normal flight controller usually available in the market are costly and are preprogrammed modules.Instead if we can use it arduino based then we can replicate similar functionalities by integration with various sensor for better caliberation and handling of the module.More over these drones can be highly used for agricultural,safety,surveillance,traffic control,forest fire,delivering and many more.
